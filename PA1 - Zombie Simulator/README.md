This assignment is a Zombie Simulator, calculating the amount of infected humans based on the population, # of initial zombies, and # of nights.
I had my first exposure to functional programming with this assignment, and also explored topics such as the rand() function.

Instructions:

Compile: g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 PA1.cpp -o PA1

Run: ./PA1
