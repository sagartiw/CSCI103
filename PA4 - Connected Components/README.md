This assignment is an image processing program, using RGB values to organize objects into "connected components". 
In doing so, users can apply filters to selective parts of an image. In this folder, there is a standard coins.bmp file that has been transformed into greyscale,
black and white, and random colored segmentation. 

Instructions:

Compile: make all

Run: ./label <filter type: "gray", "binary", "segment"> <input image (Ex. coins.bmp)> <output image (Ex. coins_gray.bmp)>
