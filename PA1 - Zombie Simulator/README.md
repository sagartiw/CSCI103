This assignment is a Zombie Simulator, calculating the # of days until complete infection based on the population, # of initial zombies, and # of simulations run. Output consists of an average, min, and max number of days for complete infection.
I had my first exposure to functional programming with this assignment, and also explored topics such as the rand() function.

Instructions:

Compile: g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 PA1.cpp -o PA1

Run: ./PA1
