This assignment is a BlackJack game. Using functional programming principles, my program allows users to play a game against a dealer. 
In order to initialize the program, the user must provide a seed value as a command line argument for my rand() functionality. 
This allows for adjustments to be made if the pseudo-random numbers are too redundant and/or produce any other errors.

Instructions:

Compile: g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 PA2.cpp -o PA2

Run: ./PA2 <Seed Value>
