This assignment is a kernel-based image filter, allowing users to process images and apply one of three filters (Sobel Kernel, Gaussian Blur, Unsharp Mask). 
The program will output the processed file in the same directory. This project consisted of command line arguments for file input, 2D array manipulation, and RGB pixel manipulation.

Instructions:

Compile: make filter

Run: ./filter <input image> <filter type: "sobel", "blur", "unsharp"> <output image (not required)>
